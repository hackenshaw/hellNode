# hellNode
A simple Node.js server template

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

`README.md`: That is this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

`public/index.html`: The static HTML page for your site.

`public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

`server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end. 

`package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

`src/`: This folder holds the source files for your site.
